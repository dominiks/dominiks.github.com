The original thought was to divide git into 'plumbing' and 'porcelain' - as if working with a toilet. In my experience git does not handle as much waste as a toilet but the analogy might still work for others. 

    Porcelain is cute name for programs and program suites depending on core git, presenting a high level access to core git. Porcelains expose more of a SCM interface than the "plumbing".
