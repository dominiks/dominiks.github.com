I have decided that it would be super cool and hip to switch from the wordpress blog that I hardly use to a static generated blog. I decided to use `Nikola <http://http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/>`_ which seems simple enough to use for a blog and static pages.

The comfort I see in a static blog is that I can just push it via git to github and use that as hosting. Whenever I want to switch the hoster I just put the static files somewhere else.

This is a leading paragraph that looks very important without seeming like a hero.

This one should no longer be important
