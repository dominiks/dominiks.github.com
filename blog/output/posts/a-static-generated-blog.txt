I have decided that it would be super cool and hip to switch from the wordpress blog that I hardly use to a static generated blog. I decided to use `Nikola <http://http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/>`_ which seems simple enough to use for a blog and static pages.

The comfort I see in a static blog is that I can just push it via git to github and use that as hosting. Whenever I want to switch the hoster I just put the static files somewhere else. And it is just plain old fun to write content with vim in restructured text and turn it with magic into a blog :-). It will take some time and posts until the posts are more appealing to the eye

What I will be writing here will mostly consist of programming topics I work on - other things I do are so much less interesting that I do not even try to write about them.
