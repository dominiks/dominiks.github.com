I decided to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; which seems simple enough to use for a blog and static pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comfort I see in a static blog is that I can just push it via git to github and use that as hosting. Whenever I want to switch the hoster I just put the static files somewhere else. And it is just plain old fun to write content with vim in restructured text and turn it with magic into a blog :-). It will take some time and posts until the posts are more appealing to the eye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I will be writing here will mostly consist of programming topics I work on - other things I do are so much less interesting that I do not even try to write about them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://www.dominik-schacht.com/blog/posts/a-statically-generated-blog.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2013 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
