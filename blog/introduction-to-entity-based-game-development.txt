Philosophy

Quidditas, inspired by the `Artemis <http://gamadu.com/artemis/>`, makes use of the following objects:

Entity
    is an object without any data attached to it - besides a unique id.

Component
    is a single object containing data for a given purpose (aspect).


Processor
    performs actions on a given set of components per entity to update the state of the entity under a speficic aspect.
