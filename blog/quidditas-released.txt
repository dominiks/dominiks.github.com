.. title: Quidditas 0.9 released
.. slug: quidditas-released

I finally managed to convince myself to publish one of my projects to the python package index. Quidditas is in a usable state - most of the work I've done on it in the past weeks was working on example projects to see if quidditas itself still has immediate problems but since I found none I can show the project to others so they can find the problems I just don't see.

The project can be visited at http://quidditas.googlecode.com and downloaded via pypi. Use::

    pip install quidditas

to install the current version 0.9. Help can be found at the project page. Additional help into the ideas of entity based game development will be available in future blog posts.
